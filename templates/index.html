    <h1>Welcome to the Inventory Admin Web App</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Glad that you stopped by to check out my inventory administrative application. This is a project that I undertook to introduce innovative ideas into the workplace. What I have created is just a prototype, so please be patient as you go through the web application.
      </p>
 <p>
 For the past three years, I have been drawing concept art all over any blank canvas that is easily accessible.  All in attempt to be able to accurately portray the ideas that I have in my head to make documentation easier for all those involved. This web application is a manifestation of those ideas.
</p>
<p>
 The purpose of this program is to innovate the audit documentation process to:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
Recording audit documentation to an integrated database
</li>
<li>
	Easy retrieval of needed information
</li>
<li>
Data needs automatically generated instead of manually compiled
</li>
<li>
	Consistent formatting across audit engagements
</li>
<li>
	Intuitive design for ease of use by all end users
</li>
<li>
	Data in readable format for validation and AI purposes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please take a look around. Hopefully you have as much fun learning about this program as I did designing it.
</p>
